# Sonia

## What the h*** is sonia?!
Sonia is an app to pull down neovim, clone a vim config, symlink everything correctly, installing vim-plug, installing the vim plugins and installing bat, fd-find and ripgrep through cargo (it'll install rustup as well).

## Why?!
Well, it's pretty much just for me. I wanna be able to get my dev-environment up and running with a single command on any linux system. Also, a few friends wanted to use the same setup - so instead of giving instructions I can now just supply a single binary to solve it.

## Can it be installed?!
Either just go to [releases](https://github.com/dvwallin/sonia/releases) or clone the repo and run `v . -prod`. It's all up to you.

## Is it stable?!
Probably not. It might work and it might destroy you're entire system and every computer you've ever seen. Don't hold me responsible.

## License?!
Read license.md perhaps?
